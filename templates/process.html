        <h3>1. Seed Sourcing & Cleaning</h3>
        <p>We source high-quality seeds from trusted local farmers. Seeds are cleaned to remove dirt, stones and foreign material.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>2. Drying & Conditioning</h3>
        <p>Seeds are gently dried and conditioned to the right moisture level — this ensures optimal oil yield without overheating.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>3. Traditional Wood/Stone Pressing</h3>
        <p>Seed kernels are pressed in wooden or stone presses at low temperatures. This mechanical pressing extracts oil while preserving nutrients.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>4. Settling & Filtration</h3>
        <p>Freshly pressed oil is allowed to settle to remove solids, then gently filtered. We avoid chemical refining — resulting oil is unrefined and nutritious.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>5. Batch Testing & Packaging</h3>
        <p>Small-batch testing (physical checks and basic lab tests). Once cleared, oil is stored in dark glass or food-grade bottles to preserve quality.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="note">We maintain low-temperature processing throughout to keep flavor and nutrients intact.</p>
